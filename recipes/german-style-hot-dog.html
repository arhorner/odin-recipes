</ul>

<h4>Steps</h4>

<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 220°c/ 200°c (Fan) and boil a kettle.</li>
    <li>Peel and finely slice your <strong>red onion</strong>.</li>
    <li>Peel and finely chop your <strong>garlic</strong>.</li>
    <li>Chop your <strong>chives</strong> finely.</li>
    <li>Heat a pot with a drizzle of <strong>vegetable oil</strong> over a medium heat. Once hot, add you <strong>yellow mustard seeds</strong> and cook for 30 secs or until sizzling.</li>
    <li>Once sizzling, add the <strong>sliced red onion</strong> and your <strong>shredded red cabbage</strong> and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, peel your <strong>potatoes</strong> and chop them into small, bite-sized pieces.</li>
    <li>Add the <strong>chopped potatoes</strong> to a separate pot with plenty of <strong>boiled water</strong> and a pinch of <strong>salt</strong> and bring to the boil over a high heat.</li>
    <li>Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 10-12 min or until fork-tender.</li>
    <li>Once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry.</li>
    <li>Once the onion and cabbage have softened, add <strong>half</strong> your <strong>cider vinegar</strong> (you'll use the rest later!) to the pot, cook for a further 30 secs then set aside to cool.</li>
    <li>Combine your <strong>mayonnaise</strong> and <strong>Dijon mustard</strong> in a separate bowl - this is your <strong>mustard mayo</strong>.</li>
    <li>Add your <strong>pork sausages</strong> to one side of a baking tray (use <strong>tin foil</strong> to avoid mess!) and put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min.</li>
    <li>Heat a large wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of <strong>vegetable oil</strong> over a high heat.</li>
    <li>Once hot, add the <strong>drained potatoes</strong> with a pinch of <strong>salt</strong> and cook for 5-6 min, stirring occasionally, or until golden and crisp.</li>
    <li>Once golden, add the <strong>chopped garlic</strong> and cook for a further 30 secs or until fragrant - these are your <strong>sauteed potatoes</strong>.</li>
    <li>Add the <strong>remaining cider vinegar</strong> to the cooled cabbage with a grind of <strong>black pepper</strong> and <strong>half</strong> of the <strong>chopped chives</strong> (save the rest for garnish!) and give everything a good mix up. This is your <strong>sauerkraut</strong>.</li>
    <li>Cut a slit into the top of each <strong>hot dog bun</strong>.</li>
    <li>Remove the tray with the sausages from the oven.</li>
    <li>Add the <strong>cut hot dog buns</strong> to the other side of the tray, then return the tray to the oven for 2-3 min or until warmed through.</li>
    <li>Fill each <strong>warmed hot dog bun</strong> with some <strong>mustard mayo</strong>, a <strong>sausage</strong> and some <strong>sauerkraut</strong>.</li>
    <li>Serve the <strong>sauteed potatoes</strong> to the side with the <strong>remaining sauerkraut</strong> and <strong>remaining mustard mayo</strong>.</li>
    <li>Garnish with the <strong>remaining chives</strong> and enjoy!</li>
